# 👖 Jeans Store

## 📋 Description

Jeans Store is an e-commerce application designed to help users browse and purchase secondhand jeans. The application features a user-friendly interface for viewing a list of available jeans, accessing detailed product information, and navigating between various product categories and pages.

🔧 Admin Panel: The admin panel enhances product management by allowing administrators to add new jeans, delete outdated items, and update product details. This ensures the product catalog remains current and accurate, providing a seamless experience for users and maintaining high-quality inventory management.

The project is still in its early stages. Future plans include adding a filter bar to enable users to filter products based on various criteria, adding a user panel to mark favorite products, and adding products to the cart.

## 💡 Motivation

This endeavor not only helps in managing her inventory efficiently but also promotes eco-friendly fashion choices.
